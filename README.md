# DBench-Java
Defect detection benchmark


In Java, we have collected resource leak, NPE and SQL injection defects in Java programming language. The number of defects in each category is as follows:
| categories | number | 
| ------ | ------ |
| resource leak | 513 |
| NPE | 209 |
| SQL injection | 46 |
| XSS | 177|

Each directory, such as JLeaks, JNPES and JSQLIs, contains defect-specific information and the corresponding source code files. We will further add some data on XSS.
